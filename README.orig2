To install the syntax highlighting for Promela, 
used with SPIN, for the Vim editor.


Step 1:

Copy the file promela.vim to the Vim syntax directory.
This directory is usually  ~/.vim/syntax/
If this directory do not exists, please create it.


Step 2:

Now test to see if you already have a ~/.vim/filetype.vim
file. If not, just move the file filetype.vim to that location.
Otherwise copy and paste the necessary part to your
~/.vim/filetype.vim file.


Finished:

Now by opening any *.prom or *.prm file, Vim will automatically
open it with the Promela syntax highlighting activated.
